This project uses deep learning techniques to classify images of cats and dogs. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on a dataset containing images of cats and dogs, and the trained model is used to predict the class of new images. The dataset can be downloaded from this link . The provided CNN model lays the groundwork for image classification and can be easily adapted to differentiate between any two categories with minimal modifications. This project is designed as an entry point for image classification tasks and is scalable for more extensive applications. In future work, I plan to expand this concept to handle more complex datasets, enabling the identification of multiple categories. Stay tuned for updates! Feel free to explore the code, experiment with various datasets, and customize the model for your specific requirements. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to open an issue.
